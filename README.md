## Introduction

This project is a part of a Java project series that emphasizes building major projects to 
provide a learning experience in Java and project development. The Student Result 
Management System is a portal/software designed to display student results and includes an 
admin section for backend management and security features.

The project is divided into two sections: admin and student, each with different permissions and access levels. The admin section allows for result management, student registration, and other administrative tasks, while the student section enables students to view their results.

## Project Overview

The Student Result Management System is developed using Java, Java Swing, Jframe, and MySQL database. Java is used for writing the business logic, including object-oriented programming concepts. Java Swing is utilized for creating lightweight applications with user interface components, and Jframe provides the main window for placing and coding components. MySQL is used for storing and accessing data, and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is used for MySQL functions.
